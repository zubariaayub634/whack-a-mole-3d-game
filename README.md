## Textual Requirements from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1GKfOEJPgQ

Countdown system in start of game
Score tracking and timer for each level
required score for each level will be determined by some background formula
7 placeholders for moles to come out from
different types of moles come out of holes randomly - hint: procedural generational of level
when you hit a mole, there is an explode animation + audio effects at touch point and mole goes back in hole after it get required number of hits - when mole goes back in, there are floating scores that also add to the ongoing score at top of screen
each type of mole will have its own rarity and its own points and number of hits it can take
game over screen if player fails to achieve the required score for level - show level and score and button to allow going to main screen
go to next level if player succeeds
Additional: think of more gameplay features or improvements to current ones
build an android app out of the unity project and deploy on play store
bonus: explore idea of a multiplayer whack a mole game
bonus: explore increasing number and placement of holes with levels
